						<h5>What Progress has been made?</h5>
						<p>Ireland is ranked 8th out of 12* in terms of this SDG. This may in part be due to limited data availability for measuring the progress that has been made towards it. Some recommendations have been given to help improve Ireland's efforts towards the SDGs. These were split into two parts, things to do on a national level and things to do on a local level:</p>
						<p>National:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The National Integrated Maritime Plan needs to be fully implemented</li>
							<li>Regulate harvesting and end over-fishing</li>
							<li>Implement policies to help fishing stocks to recover to sustainable levels.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Local:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Put a plan in place to tackle pesticides in drinking water</li>
							<li>Implement the 'nature' programs that are in the Climate Action Plan published by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment</li>
						</ul>
